Extract meaningful relationships between entities in the following text. 
The text is in Vietnamese about university regulations.

Text: {text}

Entities: {entities}

For each pair of entities that have a clear relationship, identify the relationship verb or phrase.
Format your response as a JSON array of objects with the following structure:
[
    {{
    "source": "Entity1",
    "target": "Entity2",
    "relationship": "relationship_verb"
    }}
]

Only include relationships that are explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text.
If no clear relationships exist, return an empty array.
Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or code blocks - just return the raw JSON.
